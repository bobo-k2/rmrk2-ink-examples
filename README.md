**NOTE: Still under heavy development**

This repository showcases a collection of examples on how to use RMRK2 with Ink! [contract](https://github.com/rmrk-team/rmrk-ink) implementation.

The ispiration came from a very similar [project](https://github.com/rmrk-team/rmrk2-examples) targeting RMRK2 pallet.

This is a monorepo, so do `yarn install` from the root of this repo.

###Scripts

Under `/projects/scripts` you can find scripts for deploying contracts, building NFT parts catalog and building a single Chunky NFT.

Before runing scripts install and run the latest [Swanky Node](https://github.com/AstarNetwork/swanky-node)

After Swanky Node is up and running execute the following command `yarn run-all`

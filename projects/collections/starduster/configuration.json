  "description": "As old as the universe itself, these Strdusters have transversed the entirety of the galaxy by expelling gas at a freighting force unbeknownst to mankind. What they leave behind is a cloud of strdust, which over time gathers, bonds and transforms into a new Struster. Over the course of their lives and bountiful travels, they are known to not only pick up souvenirs, but also mimic the expressions of the species they encounter.",
